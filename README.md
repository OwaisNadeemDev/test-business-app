# Test Business App README

Welcome to the Angular app! This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the app on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-angular-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move to the project directory using the following command:

   ```
   cd your-angular-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using npm, the Node.js package manager:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

Now that you have the project set up, you can run the Angular app on a local development server.

1. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```
   ng serve
   ```

   This will build the app and start a development server. By default, the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.

2. **View the App**: Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) to view the app.

## Additional Commands

Here are some additional commands you might find useful:

- **Build the App**: To build the app for production, you can use the following command:

  ```
  ng build --prod
  ```

  This will create a `dist/` directory with the optimized and minified production build of the app.

- **Run Tests**: To run unit tests for the app, use the following command:

  ```
  ng test
  ```

- **Generate Components, Directories, etc.**: Angular CLI provides various generators to quickly create components, modules, services, etc. For example, to generate a new component, use:

  ```
  ng generate component component-name
  ```

## Conclusion

You should now have the Angular app up and running on your local machine. Feel free to explore the code, make changes, and experiment with the app.
